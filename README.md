TRY TO DO THESE PROJECTS:

 1. **Black-Scholes Model Implementation:** Build a program that implements the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is fundamental for valuing European-style options.

2. **Monte Carlo Simulation for Options:** Develop a Monte Carlo simulation to price options, especially useful for complex options with various features and payoffs.

3. **Binomial Tree Model:** Create a binomial tree model for option pricing, particularly valuable for American-style options and options with discrete dividend payments.

4. **Risk Management Analysis:** Develop a risk management tool that calculates Value at Risk (VaR) or Expected Shortfall for a portfolio, and demonstrate how it can be used to make informed investment decisions.

 5. **Fixed-Income Securities Analysis:** Build a tool to analyze fixed income securities, such as bonds. This could include yield curve modeling, duration and convexity analysis, or credit risk assessment. 

 6. **Credit Derivative Pricing:** Develop models for pricing credit derivatives, like credit default swaps (CDS), which are essential for managing credit risk.

 7. Develop **capital models-PD LGD and EAD models for the Credit card, Mortgage, and Overdraft**

 8. Develop machine learning decision models using XGB and deep learning (e.g. RNN, NLP Transformer) algorithms for **adjudication and risk modeling for TD Auto loan portfolio.**

 9. Using ARCH model to create a risk dashboard for a portfolio of assets (Equities, Futures, Options, etc.) by predicting 1-day and 5-day forward vols.
    - The dashboard contains factor betas, VaR, CVaR, etc. and was calculated for a point-in-time asset portfolio using iid shocks extracted from historical equity data.
