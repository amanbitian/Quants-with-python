TRY TO DO THESE PROJECTS:

 1. **Black-Scholes Model Implementation:** Build a program that implements the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is fundamental for valuing European-style options.

2. **Monte Carlo Simulation for Options:** Develop a Monte Carlo simulation to price options, especially useful for complex options with various features and payoffs.

3. **Binomial Tree Model:** Create a binomial tree model for option pricing, particularly valuable for American-style options and options with discrete dividend payments.

4. **Risk Management Analysis:** Develop a risk management tool that calculates Value at Risk (VaR) or Expected Shortfall for a portfolio, and demonstrate how it can be used to make informed investment decisions.

 5. **Fixed-Income Securities Analysis:** Build a tool to analyze fixed income securities, such as bonds. This could include yield curve modeling, duration and convexity analysis, or credit risk assessment. 

 6. **Credit Derivative Pricing:** Develop models for pricing credit derivatives, like credit default swaps (CDS), which are essential for managing credit risk.
